CNAME to redirect https://jesse-r-s-hines.github.io to https://multithreading.jesse-r-s-hines.com which has the running server.

We used to have github.io serving static pages for just the front end portion of the project, but now we have an actual server running the whole thing so just redirect github pages to our server.
