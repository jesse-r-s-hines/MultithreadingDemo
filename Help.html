<h1>Multithreading Demo</h1>

<p>
    This project allows you to experiment with and demonstrate concurrency, the various problems it can cause, and
    solutions to those problems.  You can demonstrate race conditions, deadlock, and synchronization primitives such
    as locks, condition variables and semaphores. Click "Open" in the top right to view an index of demo examples, or
    to create your own.
</p>

<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<p>
    A demo has two main sections, one globals section which is at the top, and one or more threads side by side
    at the bottom of the screen. You can have as many threads as you want, and can make your own programs. All
    of the threads can read and write to variables defined in the globals section, but threads can't access
    each other's data.
</p>
<p>    
    Once you have some code in the globals and threads sections, you can run the demo. You will see a compiled
    version of the code next to each thread, in MIPS-like assembly.  You then act as the scheduler yourself,
    allowing you to control the exact order each thread gets executed in. You use the "step" button above each
    thread to move one instruction forward in its execution. 
</p>
<p>
    To be able to save a demo permanently you'll need to log in and make an account. Then, make sure to hit "Save"
    before you leave, so you don't have to remake the demo! 
</p>

<h3>The Language</h3>
<p>
    The language you can use is mostly a sub-set of C. You can set and modify variables, do arithmetic, and preform
    loops and conditionals.  It can recognize 5 variable types: int, bool, mutex, cond_var, and sem.
</p>
<p>
    You can use any of the 3 synchronization primitives, mutexes, condition variables, and semaphores. The following
    procedures and functions are available to work with them:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        lock(mutex m)
        <p>
            Tries to aquire the given mutex. If the mutex is free, it will be marked as held and the calling thread
            will continue into the critical section. If the mutex is already held, the thread will block until it
            becomes available.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        unlock(mutex m)
        <p>
            Releases the given mutex so that another thread can enter the critcal section.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        cond_wait(cond_var c)
        <p>
            Blocks the calling thread until another thread calls cond_signal on the same cond_var. Unlike C's 
            pthread_cond_wait you don't need to surround the call to cond_wait with a mutex.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        cond_signal(cond_var c)
        <p>
            Wakes all threads that were waiting on the given condition variable. Unlike C's pthread_cond_signal
            you don't need to surround the call to cond_wait with a mutex.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        sem_create(int value)
        <p>
            Creates and returns a semaphore with the given initial value.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        sem_wait(sem s)
        <p>
            If the value of s is 1 or greater, it will decrement the value of s and the calling thread will continue
            forward right away. If s's value is 0 or less it will decrement the value of s and block until it is
            released by a call to sem_post on the same semaphore by another thread.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        sem_post(sem s)
        <p>
            Increments the value of s, and if there are any threads waiting on the given semaphore, it will wake one.
            If there is more one thread waiting on the semaphore, it will give the user the option to choose one
            to wake.    
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
    
<h3>Examples</h3>
<div class="border border-primary mb-2">
<textarea id="examples" readonly>
int counter = 1 + 6 / 2;
bool b = true;
mutex m;
cond_var c;
sem s = sem_create(1);

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    lock(m);
        counter++;
    unlock(m);
}

int j = 0;
while (j < 10) {
    sem_wait(s);
        counter++;
    sem_post(s);
}

cond_signal(c);
cond_wait(c);
</textarea>
</div>


<h3>Playbacks</h3>
<p>
    Once your have a demo set up, you may have specific paths of execution through the threads that cause whatever 
    problem or situation you are trying to demonstrate.   You can record those specific play throughs, and then play
    them back later.  Use the record button, and then step through the threads as you would normally. When you are
    finished press the stop recording button and it will let you name and save the recorded playback. You can have
    multiple playbacks if you want.  To replay the playback, select it from the playback dropdown and hit the play
    playback button (below the dropdown).
